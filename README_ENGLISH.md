# Project A
This project has its objective to create a system, in a site, that shows some data about properties in urban areas, like the prices of the properties, the average $/m2, and comparisons between 2013 to 2023 of separate data by Street or Neighborhood, you can choose it in the filter.

## In Progress
At the moment, the unique urban area added was São Paulo downtown, but, we have enough data to cover a big part of all the areas in São Paulo's capital.

## OBS
The data kept in the database is based on research and analysis of historical data and was generated using a randomization method, generating numbers the nearest possible to reality.

I know about the price difference between Streets in the same Neighborhood, but all the data were generated for each Neighborhood, so normally all the streets of the same area will have a similar average.

Explanations about the method used to randomize the information will be documented and posted in this repertory.
